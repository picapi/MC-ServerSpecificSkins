# Server Specific Skins

This is a simple Fabric mod which adds the capability to set skins which should be applied when joining each server.

**Please note, at present skins are automatically applied prior to connecting to a server, and not reverted after disconnecting.**

## Installing the Mod
To install this mod, you'll need to have the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) set up for a given installation of Minecraft.

Then, head to our [Releases page](https://github.com/picapi/MC-ServerSpecificSkins/releases), find the latest version that functions with your version of Minecraft, and download the JAR file from the Assets listed below.
Place that JAR file in your mods folder, and you're good to go!

## Using the Mod
The mod adds buttons to the default Server Add and Edit pages to configure things per server. It should be pretty self explanatory - you can choose a server specific skin, remove one you've set, and choose the model type you want.
Then, when you join the server, the mod performs a couple of checks on your current skin, and changes it to your chosen one if it isn't already prior to attempting to connect.
